The only bug in my design is that for some reason it takes 2 clock cycles for
the valid cells in the cache to reset instead of just 1. Please take this
into account when running test benches, otherwise the valid cells will start
out undefined, which causes hit_miss calculation to fail.

I didn't have time to make proper test benches for every module, so I made
test benches with hard coded timing that can be checked using the waveform
viewer. Every *test.vhd or *Test.vhd is a testbench and has its results 
shown in the report.
